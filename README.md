Reforged is an unofficial mod for [Anti-Idle: The Game](https://aitg.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page). It provides a somewhat better experience across all features and not just Battle Arena, with new and interesting additions, a lot of balances and much more.

Every feature in Reforged has been extended, with new or reworked content:
- Progress beyond Tukkonium in [Battle Arena](https://aitg.miraheze.org/wiki/Reforged#Battle_Arena), and fight new enemies and raids! Collect stronger and unique equipment.
- A new [Badges](https://aitg.miraheze.org/wiki/Reforged#Button) mechanic in the Button.
- Reworked [Stadium](https://aitg.miraheze.org/wiki/Reforged#Stadium) Death Match, and a new Boss Fight mode!
- New cards and harder opponents in [TukkunFCG](https://aitg.miraheze.org/wiki/Reforged#TukkunFCG).
- [Fishing](https://aitg.miraheze.org/wiki/Reforged#Fishing) now has a speed fishing mode!
- Cakes and [toppings](https://aitg.miraheze.org/wiki/Reforged#Toppings)!
- A new ascension system, and more content past Ascensions!
